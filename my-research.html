                                            Privacy is a fundamental human right, ensuring that an individual’s personal
                                            information is protected from access by unauthorized entities. In the modern
                                            age of the internet, privacy has become increasingly important as businesses
                                            and organizations collect vast amounts of information from users across the
                                            globe. <br><br>
                                            A website is required to have a Privacy Policy, which is a legal document
                                            that binds the website's owners to a strict guideline outlining how they
                                            collect, use, and safeguard any personal information gathered from users.
                                            Below is an overview of the New Zealand Privacy Act 2020's 13 Privacy
                                            Principles, which provide a framework for handling personal information.

                                            <strong>7. Correction of Information:</strong><br> Individuals have the
                                            right to request

                                            <strong>8. Accuracy of Information:</strong><br> Agencies must take
                                            reasonable steps to ensure
                                            the information they hold is accurate and up-to-date. <br><br>
                                            <strong>9. Retention of Information:</strong><br> Personal information must
                                            not be kept longer
                                            than necessary for the purpose it was collected. <br><br>
                                            <strong>10. Use of Information:</strong><br> Personal information can only
                                            be used for the
                                            purpose it was collected unless an exception applies. <br><br>
                                            <strong>11. Disclosure of Information:</strong><br> Personal information
                                            should not be disclosed

                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>12. Unique Identifiers:</strong><br> Agencies should avoid assigning

                                            unless necessary to carry out their functions. <br><br>
                                            <strong>13. Cross-border Disclosure:</strong><br> When disclosing
                                            information to overseas
                                            entities, agencies must ensure the recipient protects the information as
                                            well as the NZ Privacy Act requires. <br>

                                        <p>
                                            Any privacy policy should (at a minimum) clearly state what information is
                                            being collected from users (such as name, email address, etc).

                                            It should also state how the personal information is being used, and who it
                                            will be shared with (if at all).

                                            The privacy policy must also explain to users how they can control their
                                            personal data, such as opting out of the collection of their data or posting
                                            a request to have their personal information deleted.

                                            Search Engine Optimization (abbreviated to SEO) is the way your website can
                                            be optimized to improve the visibility of your website in search engine
                                            results
                                            (such as google).
                                            <br><br>
                                            Effective Search Engine Optimization is directly attributed to increased
                                            traffic on a website, and therefore increased awareness of a brand or
                                            service.

                                            There are many key strategies to enhance a websites SEO:

                                            <strong>1. Key word optimization:</strong> <br>
                                            Incorporating relevant keywords (directly related to your website’s content)
                                            in your websites titles, headings, and bodies of text will help users find
                                            your website.<br><br>
                                            <strong>2. High Quality Content:</strong><br>
                                            Content that is informative or valuable to your target audience is more
                                            likely to be shared (or linked) to other users/websites, which increases
                                            your websites presence on the internet.<br><br>
                                            <strong>3. Website Speed:</strong> <br>

                                        <p>
                                            Choosing the right web hosting provider is paramount to the success of a
                                            website. <br>
                                            A hosting provider affects your website's performance, responsiveness,
                                            reliability, and scalability. <br>
                                            Below are 5 factors to consider when selecting a web hosting provider:
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <strong>1. Reliability:</strong><br>
                                            A web hosting provider must guarantee a high uptime (as close to 100% as
                                            possible) to ensure that a website is always accessible. <br>
                                            Downtime results in lost revenue, brand awareness, credibility, and above
                                            all, a poor user experience. <br><br>
                                            <strong>2. Customer Support:</strong> <br>
                                            Quality customer support is essential when evaluating the usefulness of a
                                            web hosting provider. Providers that offer 24/7
                                            support through multiple channels (chat, email, phone) are preferred. This
                                            determines how quickly an issue can be resolved,
                                            minimizing any disruptions. <br><br>
                                            <strong>3. Scalability:</strong> <br>
                                            As a website increases in both content size and user base, more resources
                                            will be needed. A web hosting provider that offers
                                            scalable plans allows websites to upgrade or downgrade as needed, without
                                            significant disruption to users. <br><br>
                                            <strong>4. Security:</strong> <br>
                                            A web hosting provider must have strong security measures to protect
                                            websites from hacking, malware, and data breaches.
                                            Features like SSL certificates, regular backups, and firewall protection
                                            should be standard to ensure the safety of user
                                            data and website functionality. <br><br>
                                            <strong>5. Pricing and Value for Money:</strong> <br>
                                            It's important to choose a hosting provider that offers a balance between
                                            cost and features. While cheaper plans might be
                                            attractive, they often come with limited resources or support. Assessing the
                                            features offered for the price will help you
                                            ensure you're getting the best value for your needs.

                                            Web performance is about how fast a website loads and runs on any given
                                            user’s device.<br>
                                            Good performance is important to retain visitors and ensure a positive
                                            experience for users. <br>
                                            Regular maintenance of a website ensures that it remains functional, secure,
                                            and up-to-date. <br>
                                            Below are some methods to ensure good web performance:
                                        </p>

                                        <p>
                                            <strong>1. Optimized Images:</strong> <br>
                                            Large images can slow down website loading times. Use compression techniques
                                            to reduce file size without compromising quality, and choose appropriate
                                            formats such as JPEG or PNG.<br><br>
                                            <strong>2. Minify CSS and JavaScript:</strong> <br>
                                            Minification removes unnecessary characters (such as spaces, comments) from
                                            CSS and JavaScript files, reducing file sizes and speeding up page load
                                            times.<br><br>
                                            <strong>3. Enable Browser Caching:</strong> <br>
                                            Browser caching stores elements of a website on a user’s device, allowing
                                            the site to load faster when revisited by retrieving stored data instead of
                                            reloading all content.<br><br>
                                            <strong>4. Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN):</strong> <br>
                                            A CDN stores website files across multiple servers around the globe,
                                            allowing users to access content from the server closest to them, reducing

                                            Minimizing the number of HTTP requests by combining CSS and JavaScript
                                            files, as well as limiting the number of images, can significantly reduce
                                            load times.<br><br>

                                            In addition to performance improvements, regular maintenance is crucial to
                                            keep the website functional and secure. Below are 5 important maintenance
                                            tasks:

                                            <strong>1. Backup Regularly:</strong> <br>
                                            A regular backup of all website data will ensure that a website can be
                                            restored to a previous state, in the case where data loss or an attack takes
                                            place.<br><br>
                                            <strong>2. Update Software and Plugins:</strong> <br>
                                            By keeping a websites content management system and plugins
                                            up-to-date ensures security patches and performance improvements are applied
                                            regularly.<br><br>
                                            <strong>3. Monitor for Broken Links:</strong> <br>
                                            A regular check for and (and fix of) broken links will improve overall user
                                            experience and
                                            search engine optimization (SEO). Broken links can frustrate users and
                                            negatively impact search rankings.<br><br>
                                            <strong>4. Check Website Speed:</strong> <br>
                                            A periodic test of a websites loading speed (using tools like Google
                                            PageSpeed Insights) ensures that performance stays optimal, particularly as
                                            content
                                            grows.<br><br>
                                            <strong>5. Security Audits:</strong> <br>
                                            By performing regular security checks (including scanning for malware and
                                            vulnerabilities) ensures that a website remains secure and protected from
                                            potential attacks.<br><br>

                                            Web security is one of the most important aspects
                                            where maintaining a safe
                                            and trustworthy website is concerned.<br>
                                            Websites are often the target of various
                                            “cyber-attacks” – each with its own
                                            unique methods of attack and degrees of impact on
                                            both users and
                                            data.<br><br>
                                            Below are some of the more common kinds of
                                            cyber-attacks, and how to go
                                            about preventing them:

                                        <p>
                                            <strong>1. Phishing Attacks:</strong><br>
                                            Phishing attacks occur when a user is fooled into
                                            providing sensitive
                                            information (e.g. password or credit card details)
                                            to an untrustworthy
                                            entity. This attack is performed by a website (or
                                            email agent) that pretends
                                            to represent a verified company/entity.<br><br>
                                            To prevent Phishing attacks, a user can implement a
                                            robust approach to email
                                            filtering, employing a system to block “suspicious
                                            messages”, and also to
                                            conduct/attend user education programmes to help
                                            users raise awareness about
                                            (and recognize) an attempted phishing
                                            attack.<br><br>
                                            <strong>2. SQL Injection: </strong><br>
                                            SQL Injection is a form of cyber-attack where
                                            malicious SQL code is ran as a
                                            query, to manipulated a targeted database and gain
                                            (usually) unauthorized
                                            access to sensitive data.<br><br>
                                            To prevent SQL Injection attacks, the use of strong
                                            input validation will
                                            ensure that only valid data is accepted and
                                            processed.<br><br>
                                            <strong>3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> <br>
                                            XSS Attacks involve the injection of a malicious
                                            script(s) into a target
                                            webpage. The aim is usually to either steal data or
                                            deface the website. This
                                            is a similar attack to a SQL Injection attack.
                                            <br><br>
                                            To prevent XSS attacks, the adoption of secure
                                            coding practices is paramount
                                            to preventing the injection of malicious code. This
                                            can be done by:<br><br>
                                            - Sanitizing user inputs
                                            - Escaping special characters
                                            - Using content security policies (CSP) to block
                                            malicious scripts. <br><br>
                                            <strong>4. Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS):</strong> <br>
                                            DDOS attacks flood a server with an overwhelming
                                            volume of traffic, which
                                            renders a website or service inoperable and
                                            therefore unavailable to other
                                            users. <br><br>
                                            To prevent DDOS attacks, the implementation of a
                                            traffic monitoring system
                                            designed to detect unusual spikes and deploy a CDN
                                            (content delivery
                                            network) will distribute traffic across multiple
                                            servers. This will absorb
                                            any sudden traffic surges, rendering a DDOS
                                            ineffective.<br><br>
                                            <strong>5. Malware: </strong><br>
                                            Malware often refers to a kind of malicious software
                                            (often called a
                                            “virus”) that can and will harm or exploit systems,
                                            users, sensitive data,
                                            and aid in the gaining of unauthorized access to
                                            networks or private
                                            information.<br><br>
                                            Malware attacks can be prevented by using reliable
                                            security software(s).<br>
                                            This software will detect and remove malware, keep
                                            malware-detection
                                            systems, applications and libraries updated to patch
                                            over vulnerabilities,
                                            and regularly monitor networks for “suspicious”
                                            activities and/or unusual
